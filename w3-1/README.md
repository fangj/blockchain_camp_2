# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


npx hardhat run scripts/deployMyERC20.js --network ganache

MyERC20 deployed to 0xAfD4Aac7C52535c6de19F3b5EA0d6E742239aAc8
Vault deployed to 0x085EA48B1620134779aDbB3a7F293Cf38797Bcb3
